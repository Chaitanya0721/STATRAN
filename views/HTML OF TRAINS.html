          The Indian railway system is regarded as the foundation and lifeblood of the economy. Indian railways span over thousands of kilometres practically covering the entire nation, making it the fourth largest in the world after the US, China and Russia. The Railways Board, which has a monopoly over the provision of rail services in India, is in charge of overseeing the whole infrastructure. Due to its low cost and effective operations, railways continues to be the most popular means of transportation for the majority of Indians when travelling long distances.

India's railway network is recognised as one of the largest railway systems in the world under single management. The railway network is also ideal for long-distance travel and movement of bulk commodities, apart from being an energy efficient and economic mode of conveyance and transport. Indian Railways is the preferred carrier of automobiles in the country.

Government of India has focused on investing in railway infrastructure by making investor-friendly policies. It has moved quickly to enable Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in railways to improve infrastructure for freight and high-speed trains. At present, several domestic and foreign companies are also looking to invest in Indian rail projects.<br><br>
